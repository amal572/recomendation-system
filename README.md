# Recommendation System

This project aims to build a recommendation system for the book dataset. You can download it from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset).

## Overview

The recommendation system will consist of the following components:

1. **Popularity Recommendation System:**
   - This system will recommend books based on their popularity, taking into account user ratings and the name of the author and publisher.

2. **Content-Based Recommendation System:**
   - Utilizing features such as the name of the book, author, and publisher, this system will recommend books similar to those a user has liked.

3. **Collaborative Filtering System:**
   - This system will recommend books based on the preferences of similar users. It will analyze user-item interactions to make personalized recommendations.

4. **Hybrid Recommendation System:**
   - Integrating the results from the content-based and collaborative filtering systems, this hybrid system will provide enhanced recommendations by combining the strengths of both approaches.

## Repository Structure

- **/data**: Contains the book dataset.
- **/scripts**: Includes scripts for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and building recommendation models.
- **/models**: Stores trained recommendation models.
- **/results**: Holds evaluation metrics and visualization of recommendation results.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Preprocess the book dataset, handle missing values, and extract relevant features.
2. **Model Building:**
   - Build and train the recommendation models, including popularity-based, content-based, collaborative filtering, and hybrid models.
3. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the performance of the recommendation systems using metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy.
4. **Usage Example:**
   - Demonstrate how to use the recommendation system to provide personalized book recommendations for users.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, sentence_transformers)
